## General-specific guidance

- Do use correct English (preferably US) everywhere applicable.
- ISO Code and Unicode should also be UTF-8
- Camel casing and naming conventions should be the foundation
- Use good logic and common design practices and principles when solution building
- Arrogance/Shyness do not work with learning - so be humble.
- Keep up to date with industry practices but accept that business commercials will always be a priority.

## Let the project define the style

As with most parts of software development, it's better to be consistent than
perfect. If your repository already has a style then follow it. This also includes engineering decisions. If the project uses Angular 1.6 and it works well compared to use Angular 2 and TypeScript then stick with 1.6 do not fanboy or bash based on insecurities or irrational mindsets.
